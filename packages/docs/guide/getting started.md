# Getting Started

There's a few different ways to create a Vue-Bridge project. The quickest and easiest way is to clone one of our templates on github (see below), but you can also configure your project setup yourself manually. We have a guide for this further down.

::: info 

We also plan on creating a `create-vue-bridge` package so you can do that from the command line:

```bash
npx init vue-bridge

yarn create vue-bridge
```

But that will take us a while

# Compatibility Listing


This Page details all of the differences between Vue 2 and 3 that you will have to be aware of and account for when writing cross-compatible code.

Each of the points listed has it's own dedicated page explaining how to deal with it, and how to do so in the safest and easiest way possible.

## Legend

| Badge          | Description                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| <eslint />     | Compat can be ensured by an eslint rule                              |
| <plugin />     | Compat is (at least partially) provided by the `@vue-bridge/runtime` plugin |
| <discipline /> | Compat needs to be ensured by the developer without tooling support. Following these rules is generally straightforward and low-risk  |
| <pitfall />    | Like <discipline />, but with a noteworthy risk of introducing bugs because these are easy to miss |

This can seem like a lot, so make sure to read the Guide to learn how to navigate all of this.

## ðŸ›‘ Incompatible

These concern features / syntax that is straight up incompatible, though some have workarounds.

- Don' use [Multiple Root elements / Fragments](/guides/template/multiple-root-elements.md) <eslint />

- Always respect `v-bind` order precedence of Vue 3 <pitfall />
